MUSIC RECOMMDATION SYSTEM  Spotify's recommendation system, powered by machine learning, predicts a user's likelihood of repeatedly listening to a song within a set timeframe. Using a dataset with 1 indicating repeated plays within a month, it tracks user song histories and timestamps to generate personalized song recommendations.

# Music Recommendation System

## Project Overview

The **Music Recommendation System** aims to predict the likelihood that a user will enjoy a song. By analyzing the user's past song history and the properties of the music, the system generates a list of recommended tracks. The model leverages the Spotify dataset, which contains a variety of features such as acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo, valence, and more.

Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

**User Personalization**: Create a personalized experience by recommending tracks based on individual tastes and listening habits.
- **Feature Utilization**: Effectively utilize features available in the Spotify dataset, such as acoustic properties and metadata, to inform the recommendation algorithms.
- **Model Accuracy**: Develop a Machine Learning model that accurately predicts user preferences, aiming for high precision and recall in recommendations.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle a large number of users and songs without a decline in performance.
- **User Engagement**: Increase user engagement by providing relevant song recommendations that encourage further interaction with the service.
- **Algorithm Diversity**: Explore and implement different recommendation algorithms, evaluating their effectiveness for this specific application.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform comprehensive data analysis to understand user behavior and song popularity, improving the recommendation engine.
- **Continuous Learning**: Implement a system that learns over time, enhancing recommendations as more data on user preferences is collected.
